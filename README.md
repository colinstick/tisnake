# TIsnake
A simple snake game to played on a TI-84+ CE calculator.

I have attached just the source files so you can use the tutorial [here](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html) to get it set up and running.

## Controls
Arrow keys to move. Press 2nd to exit the game.

## Objective
Eat as many apples as possible. Eating an apple increases your length by one unit. Hitting the borders of the screen or yourself will exit the game.
